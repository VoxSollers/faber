# Contributing to Faber

Thanks for taking the time. This file covers what you need to get the project running and what a pull request has to satisfy to be merged.

For architectural conventions — module layout, vertical slices, ErrorOr, Angular patterns — read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first. It is the source of truth, and it is short.

## Getting set up

### 1. Prerequisites

.NET 8 SDK or newer, Node.js 24 (the version CI pins in `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`), Docker Desktop or another OCI-compatible container runtime, and the Aspire CLI. The orchestrator (DCP) and the dashboard come from the CLI's bundle, so the installed CLI must be at least the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version pinned in `src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost/Faber.AppHost.csproj`; an older one fails at startup with `Newer version of the Aspire.Hosting.AppHost package is required`.

```bash
curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash
aspire --version
```

The printed version must be at least the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version pinned in `Faber.AppHost.csproj`.

Bumping the `Aspire.*` packages therefore means bumping the CLI too. Rebuild the AppHost after updating the CLI: the bundle paths are baked into the assembly at build time.

`dotnet-ef` is pinned in `.config/dotnet-tools.json`; `dotnet tool restore` is only needed to add a migration, not to run the stack.

### 2. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VoxSollers/faber.git
cd faber
```

### 3. Parameters

The AppHost reads four required values from .NET user-secrets, never from the repository:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:postgres-username" "<POSTGRES-USERNAME>" --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:postgres-password" "<POSTGRES-PASSWORD>" --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:keycloak-admin" "<KEYCLOAK-ADMIN-USERNAME>" --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:keycloak-password" "<KEYCLOAK-PASSWORD>" --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
```

The user-secret store is keyed by the `<UserSecretsId>` GUID tracked in `Faber.AppHost.csproj`, not by the checkout path, so every clone on the machine reads the same `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<id>/secrets.json` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<id>\secrets.json`). A second clone therefore starts already configured; to check the setup genuinely from scratch, move that file aside first.

The Postgres values take effect only when the checkout's database volume is first created; changing them later needs the volume removed — see [Resetting local state](#resetting-local-state).

### 4. First run

```bash
dotnet run --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
```

`aspire run` from the repository root is equivalent — `aspire.config.json` points it at the AppHost. The Aspire dashboard opens automatically at `https://localhost:15xxx` (the port is printed in the console).

On a clean clone, Vault is not initialized yet: it stays unhealthy, and `bootstrap` and `faberapi` wait for it (the dashboard names the missing `vault-token` parameter). Expect the following in the logs — all of it is harmless:

- `Couldn't start vault with IPC_LOCK. Disabling IPC_LOCK, please use --cap-add IPC_LOCK` — `infra/vault/config/config.hcl` sets `disable_mlock = true` deliberately, so memory locking is not wanted.
- `core: security barrier not initialized`, repeating every few seconds — Vault waiting to be initialized, which the next step does.
- On the first run against an empty database, `migrations` logs four `Failed executing DbCommand` errors for `SELECT migration_id, product_version FROM …_migrations_history` — EF Core queries the history table before it exists and handles the error itself; the service still exits with code 0, and they do not appear on later runs.

### 5. Initialize Vault

Leave the AppHost running. The Vault container already ships the `vault` binary with `VAULT_ADDR` set, so drive it with `docker exec` instead of installing anything else; its container name has a random suffix, so resolve it with `docker ps`.

1. Initialize — one key share and a threshold of one suit a local stack:

```bash
docker exec "$(docker ps -qf 'name=^vault-')" \
  vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
```

2. Create the key file the AppHost's unseal hook reads:

```bash
printf 'UNSEAL_KEY_1=%s\n' '<UNSEAL-KEY>' > infra/vault/.vault-unseal-keys
```

3. Store the root token outside the repository:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "Parameters:vault-token" "<ROOT-TOKEN>" \
  --project src/api/Aspire/Faber.AppHost
```

`vault operator init` prints `Unseal Key 1` and `Initial Root Token` **once**; they cannot be retrieved again. If lost, reset Vault as described in [Resetting local state](#resetting-local-state) and initialize again. A second `init` on the same data fails with `Vault is already initialized`.

Any number of shares and threshold works, the defaults of five and three included; the file only has to hold at least `threshold` keys. `infra/vault/.vault-unseal-keys` does not exist in a clean clone — the command above creates it, and Git ignores it.

In that file, blank lines, lines starting with `#`, and any line that does not start with `UNSEAL_KEY` are ignored, so the suffix (`_1`, `_2`, …) is arbitrary. The key is everything after the first `=`, with surrounding whitespace and double quotes stripped. Only the first `threshold` keys are used.

`docker exec "$(docker ps -qf 'name=^vault-')" vault status` reports the seal state. Right after initialization it shows `Sealed true`, which is expected until the restart below. It **exits 2 while Vault is sealed** (and before initialization) and 0 once unsealed — its documented way of reporting seal state, not a failure; a script run with `set -e` would otherwise stop there.

As a browser alternative, open `http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui`, choose the same key shares/threshold, and copy the generated key and token into the same two places above.

Never commit or share the generated keys, token, or local passwords.

### 6. Restart once

Stop the AppHost and start it again (step 4). The unseal hook reads the key file and unseals Vault; the stack then brings itself up with no further manual step: `Faber.Migrations` applies migrations and creates the `keycloak` schema, Keycloak imports the tracked realm, and `Faber.Bootstrap` creates the `secrets` KV v2 mount and writes `secrets/keycloak`. Every service becomes healthy, and the one-shot `migrations` and `bootstrap` finish with exit code 0. There is no `dotnet ef database update`, no Keycloak admin-console step, and no manual Vault seeding. Mail in Development goes to Mailpit, so no Resend account or `secrets/mail` is needed.

The tracked `infra/keycloak/realm-export.json` stores the `faber-api` client secret as the placeholder `<YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET>` — that value is never used. On every start, `Faber.Bootstrap` regenerates the `faber-api` client secret through the Keycloak admin API and writes the result to `secrets/keycloak`, so nothing needs regenerating or copying by hand.

### 7. Frontend

The frontend runs separately:

```bash
cd src/web/faber-app
npm ci
npm start
```

### Resetting local state

Two pieces of local state cannot simply be reconfigured once they exist; both need the old state removed before the new configuration takes effect.

**PostgreSQL — changing the credentials, or starting with an empty database.** The Postgres image creates the `Parameters:postgres-username` role only when it initializes an empty data directory. The checkout's volume keeps that directory across runs, so changing `Parameters:postgres-username` or `Parameters:postgres-password` afterward leaves the old role in place and never creates the new one. The failure then reads like a typo in the password:

```
PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database; Skipping initialization
FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "<POSTGRES-USERNAME>"
DETAIL:  Role "<POSTGRES-USERNAME>" does not exist.
```

The fix is to remove the volume, not to re-type the password. Each checkout has its own, named `faber-postgres-data-<suffix>` where the suffix is derived from the checkout path. `docker volume ls --filter name=faber-postgres-data-` lists them all; with several checkouts on the machine, the `postgres` resource's details in the Aspire dashboard show which volume this one uses.

Stop the AppHost first. Stopping it is not enough on its own: Aspire creates a new `postgres-<random>` container on every run and leaves the exited ones behind, and any container that still references the volume — running or long exited — makes `docker volume rm` fail with `volume is in use`.

Set `volume` to the name from the listing above, then remove it:

```bash
volume=faber-postgres-data-<suffix>
docker ps -aq --filter volume="$volume" | xargs -r docker rm -f
docker volume rm "$volume"
```

`xargs -r` skips `docker rm` when no container holds the volume, so the same commands work whether one does. The next start creates a fresh volume with the current parameters; migrations, the realm import and bootstrap then rebuild everything, so no manual step follows. Local data such as registered users is lost.

A checkout created before the per-checkout volume was introduced may still have the old fixed-name `faber-postgres-data` volume. Nothing uses it anymore; remove it the same way with `volume=faber-postgres-data`.

**Vault — a lost unseal key or root token.** `vault operator init` output cannot be retrieved again, and `vault operator rekey` needs the existing keys, so the only recovery is to discard Vault's local data and initialize again. Stop the AppHost, then:

```bash
rm -rf infra/vault/file infra/vault/.vault-unseal-keys
```

Both paths are ignored by Git. On Linux the files under `infra/vault/file` are owned by the container's user, so this may need `sudo`.

Then repeat [step 4](#4-first-run), [step 5](#5-initialize-vault) and [step 6](#6-restart-once) of Getting set up, setting the new root token over the old `Parameters:vault-token`. Nothing else has to be recreated by hand: bootstrap creates the `secrets` mount and writes `secrets/keycloak` again on the next start.

### Orchestration boundary

The Aspire AppHost is the only local orchestration definition tracked here. It is for development and is not a production deployment definition. Production Compose configuration and environment files are maintained privately in the deployment environment and are intentionally not part of this repository.

## Running the checks

Backend — build a project directly; the solution may need a newer SDK:

```bash
dotnet build src/api/Faber.Api/Faber.Api.csproj
```

Backend integration tests (Docker required):

```bash
dotnet run --project tests/Integration/Modules/Auth/Faber.Modules.Auth.Application.Tests
```

Backend unit tests (no Docker required):

```bash
dotnet run --project tests/Unit/Modules/Resumes/Faber.Modules.Resumes.Application.UnitTests
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd src/web/faber-app
npm ci
npm run check
npm test -- --watch=false
npm run build
```

Public-snapshot preflight (tracked files only; never scans private history) — requires Gitleaks 8.30.1, TruffleHog 3.97.4, and `jq` on PATH:

```bash
cd ../../..
bash scripts/verify-public-snapshot.sh --preflight
```

The three images CI builds without pushing:

```bash
docker build -f src/api/Faber.Api/Dockerfile -t faber-api:local .
docker build -f src/api/Jobs/Faber.Migrations/Dockerfile -t faber-migrations:local .
docker build -f src/web/faber-app/Dockerfile -t faber-web:local src/web/faber-app
```

Integration tests use Testcontainers, so Docker must be running. On macOS with Docker Desktop the socket is usually not at the default path — `docker context inspect --format '{{.Endpoints.docker.Host}}'` prints yours; export it as `DOCKER_HOST` if Testcontainers cannot find it automatically.

The preflight requires no staged or unstaged tracked changes, verifies required tracked files, rejects credential-bearing tracked paths and submodules, exports `HEAD`, and requires successful Gitleaks and TruffleHog scans. Gitleaks 8.30.1, TruffleHog 3.97.4, and `jq` must be installed; a missing tool fails the check. Ignored and untracked local runtime files are not exported and do not block preflight. Scanner output is suppressed so findings cannot leak into shared logs. The fail-closed final mode is reserved for verifying the new clean-snapshot repository before publication.

### Reviewing an unapproved scan candidate

TruffleHog also flags text that merely looks like a credential. Each reviewed false positive is recorded in `approved_false_positive` against a fingerprint of the flagged text itself, so edits elsewhere in the file — and the line moving — keep the exception, while rewriting the flagged text retires it and asks for a fresh review.

When preflight reports an unapproved candidate it names the detector and location but never the value, because build logs are shared. To review one:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-public-snapshot.sh --list-candidates
```

That prints every candidate in the tracked export with its fingerprint and approval status. **Open the reported line and read the flagged text before doing anything else.** If it is a real credential, move the value into Vault or user secrets and rotate it — it is already in the private history — rather than recording an exception. Only when the text is genuinely benign, add a `case` entry with its fingerprint and a comment saying what it is.

## Making a change

**Branches** are named `{issue-number}-{kebab-case-description}` — for example `207-tests-features-signin`. Open or find an issue first; it is what the branch, the PR, and the changelog all hang off.

**Commits** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): description`, where `type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, or `docs`, and `scope` names the affected area (`resumes`, `auth`, `infra`, `ui-shared`, …).

```
feat(resumes): add live accordion titles
fix(auth): reject refresh tokens issued before a password change
```

Split your work into commits by logical concern. A commit that renames files and changes behavior at the same time is hard to review and harder to revert.

**Pull request titles use the same format** and are linted by CI — a prose-only title fails the build. Squash-merged PR titles feed [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which computes the version bump and writes `CHANGELOG.md`: `feat` → minor, `fix`/`perf` → patch, `feat!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major.

The PR body must contain `Closes #N` so the linked issue closes on merge.

## What a pull request needs

- Builds pass — backend and frontend
- Tests pass, and new behavior comes with tests. Backend tests are xUnit v3 + Shouldly + NSubstitute + Bogus + Testcontainers, named `{Scenario}_Should{Outcome}`. Mock external services only (Vault, email) — never infrastructure or internal abstractions
- Frontend changes keep WCAG AA and pass the AXE specs
- No new credentials, keys, personal data, or machine-specific paths — the secret scan in CI will catch the obvious cases, but it is not a substitute for looking
- Conventional PR title with a scope, and `Closes #N` in the body

## Issue labels

Every issue carries exactly one `type:*`, one `priority:*`, and at least one `area:*`:

- `type:` — `feat` · `fix` · `refactor` · `chore` · `test` · `docs` · `perf`
- `priority:` — `p0` blocker · `p1` current focus · `p2` standard · `p3` nice-to-have
- `area:` — `auth` · `resumes` · `users` · `identity` · `notifications` · `vault` · `infra` · `ui-shared` · `ux` · `tests-infra`

New issues land in the project board's `Inbox` and are triaged weekly.
